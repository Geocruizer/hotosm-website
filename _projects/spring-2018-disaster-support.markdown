Project Summary Text: Since the beginning of May 2018, HOT has been called upon to
  respond to, or assist, a handful of disasters across the globe. Details on the projects,
  and how you can get involved are below. Maps can play a critical role in potentially
  saving the lives of millions of people worldwide, a big thank you to the mappers
  volunteering to create them.

## Somalia and Cyclone Sagar

### Context
Our first request came from the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) regarding flooding in Somalia. After delivering building data for the requested area we were asked to monitor any needs for Cyclone Sagar.

### Progress made
We were able to quickly map the areas of interest in Somalia adding over 18,000 buildings to the impacted area.

#### Results of the mapping
UNITAR was able to conduct analysis and produce maps using OpenStreetMap data: http://www.unitar.org/unosat/node/44/2806

## Ebola in the DRC

### Context
Ebola has made a resurgence in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A well prepared local OpenStreetMap community has been working with the Congolese Ministry of Public Health, local aid organizations as well as Missing Maps partners such as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) to coordinate the mapping effort. HOT is supporting this locally led response to help with mapping and validation as well as communications and coordination between stakeholders.

### Progress so far
As of May 29, 700+ mappers have added over 90,000 buildings and thousands of kilometers of road network to the map in support of relief efforts led by organisations including MSF.

### Get involved
Mapping tasks and their status can be found on the 2018 Ebola Outbreak OSM Response OSM wiki page. Map tasks here: https://tasks.hotosm.org/contribute?difficulty=ALL&campaign=Ebola2018

Data made available via HDX (generated by the HOT Export Tool) https://data.humdata.org/group/cod?organization=hot#dataset-filter-start  

## Colombia Flooding and Dam Failure
### Context
We were alerted that the OSM-Colombia community had immediately put together a project when word came that the Hidroituango dam could potentially fail. HOT has helped promote their effort and are standing by for any further needs.

### Progress so far
So far 145 mappers have mapped over 50,000 buildings around the Hidroituango dam in preparation.

### Get involved
Colombia mapping projects can be found at https://tareas.openstreetmap.co/

## Flooding in Sri Lanka
### Context
In late May, HOT was contacted with a request on behalf of the Disaster Management Centre of Sri Lanka for building data in the most heavily affected areas experiencing flooding. This is seasonal, monsoon rain and just two years ago we coordinated a similar response. The area is quite large with many buildings, so we have Activated a team to coordinate the mapping response.

### Progress so far
In just the first hours of mapping, 37 mappers have added over three thousand buildings to the area experiencing the worst of the flooding.

### Get involved
Mapping tasks can be found here: https://tasks.hotosm.org/contribute?difficulty=ALL&campaign=Disaster%20Response

## Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii
### Context
HOT monitored the eruption of Mount Kilauea from early on. Being, so far, a relatively slow progression event there has not been much need for our help except to set up a project for the local mappers. We continue to monitor and stay in contact in case things get worse.

### Progress so far
About 70 mappers have made almost 60,000 changes to the map of Hawai'i including where the fissures and lava flows are.

### View the map
The area around Leilani Estates has been heavily impacted, the mapping results can be viewed here: https://osm.org/go/Q0fnIqxI-?relation=6526869
